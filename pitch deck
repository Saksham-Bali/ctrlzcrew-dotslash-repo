Problem statement: Healthcare affordability and accessibility remains acritical chjallenge for
underprivileged people/groups. We are trying to build a system made of mulitple ml models trained
to detect various diseases based on health parameters like insulin , glucose for diabetes,
voice frequency for parkinsons and blood pressure, bpm,cholestrol for heart disease.
This can help poor people save money that would be wasted in high consultancy fees to be paid to
doctors, especially where there is a chance of a negative test and in some cases can help to 
prevent mis-diagonisis due to human error. These will allow individuals to make informed health
decisions and imporve access to quality healthcare.
